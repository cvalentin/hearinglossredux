#How the site is designed


The site is currently designed using a Header/Footer template system.

All navigation HTML and the <head> HTML is located in header.php.
The footer is located in footer.php.

Each page is loaded as it's own page (About is in about.php, etc) that contains the HTML for each page.

For the UI framework we used Foundation, with it's docs located here:
http://foundation.zurb.com/

All the custom CSS is located in /scripts/app.css, with comments spaced out for each page.

Locations has a commented out template for adding additional locations if needed.
