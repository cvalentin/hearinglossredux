		<h4>Programs</h4>
		<p>
			Our programs are designed to help the world's children who are deaf or hard of hearing access the early identification, hearing technology, and professional and family support they need to reach their potential in their hearing communities. We customize our work to meet the needs of those we support. Our core focus areas are:
		</p>
		<p>
			TRAINING: We provide on-location training, video analysis, and mentorship for audiology technicians, teachers, therapists, medical professionals, and families that work with or have children with hearing loss in developing countries.  The training is taught by Global Foundation international experts in audiology, speech language pathology, early intervention, and auditory-verbal practice. 
		</p>
		<p>
			HEARING AID DISTRIBUTION: Our Hearing Aid program delivers quality hearing devices to children in developing countries and helps facilitate ongoing audiology and education support.
		</p>
		<p>
			OUTREACH/PUBLICITY: The Global Foundation fosters partnerships with like-minded organizations, both domestic and international, to educate communities about the implications of hearing loss in infants and children and how to address them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			CONSULTATIONS: Consultation and project management is offered to government entities, hospitals, academic institutions and other organizations in developing countries that wish to establish hearing health care and educational programs to meet the needs of infants and children who are deaf or hard of hearing.
		</p>
		<p>
			RESEARCH: The Foundation supports universities and research organizations to collect data about hearing loss in developing countries that can be used to advance practices in audiology, early intervention, and auditory-verbal practice globally.
